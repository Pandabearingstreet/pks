\title{Delineate a Knowledge Structure by a Skill Function (Alternative Implementation)}
\usage{
delineate.by.cheating(skillfun, itemID = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{skillfun}{a data frame representing the skill function.
It consists of an item indicator and a problem-by-skill indicator matrix.}

\item{itemID}{index of the column in \code{skillfun} that holds the item
indicator.}
}
\value{
A matrix representing the knowledge structure delineated by the skill function.
}
\description{
Computes the knowledge structure delineated by a skill function using
specialized algorithms for conjunctive, disjunctive, and mixed skill functions.
}
\details{
This implementation automatically detects the type of skill function and applies
the appropriate delineation algorithm, which can be more efficient than the
general approach used by \code{\link{delineate}}.
